# Cloud Computing ☁️

## Purpose
The primary purpose of cloud computing is to deliver on-demand computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet. This enables users to access resources as needed without having to own, manage, or maintain their own physical hardware and infrastructure. The goal is to provide faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  
  Cloud-based platforms such as Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, and Canvas have become the backbone of modern education. They allow for the creation of virtual classrooms where teachers can distribute assignments, provide feedback, and share resources. These platforms also enable seamless real-time collaboration among students on projects and documents, transcending physical boundaries.

- **In IT**:  
  Cloud computing provides the large-scale, on-demand computing and storage capabilities required for processing and analyzing big data. IT teams leverage cloud services to build and train complex AI and machine learning models, enabling everything from real-time fraud detection to predictive analytics—without the need for a massive upfront investment in hardware.

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  **Learning Management Systems** (LMS) such as Canvas and Blackboard are cloud-based platforms used by universities and schools worldwide to host course materials, facilitate online discussions, and manage student assessments. They provide a unified learning platform accessible to all students, including those in remote locations.

- **In IT**:  
  As a leading streaming service, Netflix relies heavily on **Amazon Web Services** (AWS) to handle its massive scale and global reach. Netflix’s entire streaming infrastructure, from video storage to content delivery, is hosted on AWS. This cloud-first strategy allows the company to scale services automatically during peak viewing hours and quickly deploy new features without investing in its own data centers.
